My most updated GitHub Projects Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my GitHub Portfolio. Thank you for reading and checking out this page.

To see my projects I have completed over the years, the file is called Github_portfolio_june_2025.html, and you need to download it.

The SKY Health Check Web Application was created by a team of 5, including me. We completed the web application together, and for the other projects, all of them were created and finished by me. This shows that I work well with teams and independently.
